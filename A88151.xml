            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N a Pamphlet lately publiſhed by Mr <hi>Ioſeph He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming,</hi> [which he hath titled JUDAS EXCOMMU<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NICATED, or, <hi>A vindication of the Communion of Saints</hi> &amp;c.] there is ſo much dirt and venome vomited by him, upon my name and repute, that by his caſting, you may eaſily gueſſe the fulneſſe of his ſtomack; and get out of his way Reader; for he cares not where he lets flie, if the diſgorging fit do but once come upon him, which comes not ſeldom: He made this promiſe in an Epiſtle which he intended to prefix unto this clamorous Volumn, but ſpared it, upon curteſie to me, as he pretendeth, <hi>I am reſolved now God willing, if he retract not what he hath ſpoken, and that ſpeedily, to give his Reputation ſuch a wound, that all godly men, who love the truth, and ſpeak the truth in ſincerity, abominating lies, and ſuch as ſpeak them in hypocriſie; yea, thoſe very ungodly ones whoſe cauſe he pleads ſhall loath it, as men do a rotton ſtinking Carkaſſe, by the wayes ſide: Neither ſhall all the freinds he hath, or can poſsibly make, be ever able to ſalve it up.</hi> A very charitable and Saint like reſolution I can aſſure you; and how he hath endeavoured to make his word good, by bad words, all along his Libell, I need not to goe about to ſhew, the thing it ſelf ſpeaks it ſelfe: You ſee the mans ſpirit and temper by his own Confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion: He pretends to Argue and Reaſon, but intends to barke and bite; he takes on him tenderneſſe to the truth, which it ſeemes, if he ſtood not up for it, were utterly undone, whereas the bottome of his heart and reſolution is, to fall upon my perſon and wound my repute, and to ſerve his ſpleen up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on me, under ſuch a pretence. A man that begins to aſſume a Papall Prerogative, and in time may prove as excellent a
<pb facs="tcp:150113:4"/>Saint-maker, or Devill-maker, as his Pontificall Holineſſe of <hi>Rome</hi> himſelfe: For pleaſe him, be his white boyes, and doe as he does, and ſay as he ſayes, you ſhall preſently be a Saint, and not an Egyptian dog muſt dare to open his mouth againſt it. But, do but croſſe him never ſo little in his Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, or in his humour, and he will inſtantly make you a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane perſon, and a caſt-away, and all the friends you have can doe you no good.</p>
            <p>The occaſion of all this his heat and breaking out againſt me, was onely this, He oftentimes in the Pulpit [though I muſt tell you that I believe he is no more a lawfull Miniſter then my ſelfe] declaimed againſt the Sacrament calling it a <hi>Communion of dogs and Devils, and a rotten two peny Communion,</hi> [ſo he calls the Lords prayer <hi>a carnall fleſhly Ordinance</hi>] bragging to prove againſt all men <hi>That Iudas did not receive the Sacrament,</hi> and telling the Congregation, <hi>That if they did believe that Iudas did receive the Sacrament, they might doe as</hi> Judas <hi>did, that is, goe and receive, and then goe and hang them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves</hi> &amp;c. You cannot blame me, if ſuch paſſages as theſe ſeemed bitter to me, who as yet cannot be convinced by all that ever he hath ſpoken about it, but that <hi>Iudas</hi> did receive the Sacrament as well as any other of the Diſciples. Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon I drew up ſhort Notes upon this point, for mine own ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlement, and for ſome others ſatisfaction: Which Notes I did neither ſend to him, nor intend for him; but he getting them into his hands by ſome meanes or other, and diſdaining that his Oracularity, and <hi>ipſe dixit</hi> ſhould be croſt, he fals to <hi>Shimei</hi>'s manner of Diſpute with railing and flinging dirt and ſtones, as a man tranſported with fury, paſſion, and ſcorn to be contradicted.</p>
            <p>I am not ſolitious to ſtand upon the Vindication of mine own repute, which to wound, he hath by his own confeſſion, ſet himſelfe to work, and made it his task: [if this be to be <hi>a ſervant to all men in the Goſpel of Ieſus Christ,</hi> as hee ſtileth

               <hi>An Accuſer</hi> in his name may do as much.] I referre my cauſe to God, who knoweth my heart and actions, and who will once judge between us: and beſides the witneſſe of mine own conſcience, I dare appeal to all that know me, to give in teſtimony of my converſation: And to thoſe that know me not, I do but refer it, to weigh with what ſcorn, ſpleen, pride, and virulency Mr <hi>Heming</hi> hath ſpoken againſt me what he hath ſpoken, and then let them judge whether ſo high boyling paſſions be not ready to foam out ſcum and ſcandall.</p>
            <p>Whoſoever hath beſtowed the time and paines to read his Diſcourſe through, he doth eaſily perceive it to conſiſt of theſe four parts, Reaſoning, Railing, Boaſting, and Impertinencies: The three laſt are his own proper invention, and let him have the honour of them: but the firſt, that is, Reaſoning, or Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments, or Anſwers, or call them what you will, about the matter in diſpute between us, there is hardly one of them, but he hath ſhameleſſely ſtollen it; Come hither all yee Proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lytes and Diſciples of Mr <hi>Heming,</hi> and ſee how he uſeth you: He makes you believe that this his great elaborate volumn is his own ſtudy, and paines, and Learning; and I hope you do not a little admire him for it; he feeds you with theſe Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to prove that <hi>Iudas</hi> received not the Sacament, as if they were out of his own ſtore; whereas, they are almoſt eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry bit of them ſtollen goods, and you poor ſouls are fed with ſuch plundred proviſion; I ſuppoſe you will not take it well at his hands to be ſo ſerved as he hath ſerved you, when I tell you whence he had it: You would little think that Mr <hi>Heming</hi> ſhould feed you with the invention of a <hi>Iure-Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vino-Presbyterian Scot,</hi> and make you beleeve it is the dainty food of his own providing: Spit out for ſhame; for theſe Arguments, that you have ſo eagerly ſwallowed, digeſted and been delighted with, came out of <hi>a Iure-Divino-Presbyterian</hi> Cup-boord, were cookt and diſht up by a <hi>Iure-Divino-Presbyterian</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:150113:5" rendition="simple:additions"/>hand, and Mr <hi>Heming</hi> got them away by the vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of <hi>Hocas Pocas,</hi> and hath ſerved them up for your diet, as his own Cookery: Read but Mr <hi>Gilleſpy</hi> in his Book called <hi>Aarons rod bloſſoming,</hi> from pag. 442 to pag. 469 and there you will ſee how this Gentleman ruffles in cloathes that are none of his own, and makes you believe that he feeds you with Veniſon, when it is but kids fleſh purloined, and that from a <hi>Scot.</hi> Now fie upon that ever Mr <hi>Heming</hi> ſhould ſerve us thus.</p>
            <p>The two ſentences of Greek with which he hath flouriſhed the front of his Volumn, he hath taken out of that Book, pag. 452. and 453. word for word. The ſecond thing in his ninth page, the third thing in his tenth page, the firſt, ſecond, third and fourth things in his eleveth page, the third thing in his thirteenth page beginning thus, <hi>The Originall</hi> &amp;c. And the firſt in the ſame page, beginning with <hi>Perhaps</hi> &amp;c. In the fifteenth page, the firſt Anſwer beginning <hi>Tis true</hi> &amp;c. the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond beginning <hi>Tis as true</hi> &amp;c. and the ſecond below begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning <hi>If it had been ſaid</hi> &amp;c. The third beginning, <hi>Whereas hee affirmeth</hi> &amp;c. And from thence all whole till you come to the firſt thing in the ſixteenth page: The fourth thing in the ſix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth page, and the firſt thing in the laſt page: Theſe are all taken out of that Book of Mr <hi>Gilleſpies,</hi> as any one may ſee that will read that portion of it between thoſe pages. 442, and 469. Read it ye Saints, in and about <hi>Vttoxater,</hi> and ſee how your great Oracle ſerves you, and truſt him another time. It is his own motion in his Epiſtle to you, page 4. <hi>Let me ſee my Errata's and I ſhall endeavour to correct and amend them:</hi> Shew him this his dealing, and tell him it is not fair to ſerve either you or Mr <hi>Gilleſpy</hi> thus. For all the little affection that he beareth either to a <hi>Scot,</hi> or the <hi>Presbyterian</hi> judgement, and for all the great ſincerity that he pretends to bear to you, yet you ſee how he can make uſe of thoſe; and make bold with you to ſerve his own turn.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:150113:5" rendition="simple:additions"/>
            <p>It is certainly either a great itch that he hath to appear in publick, or a great deſire to ſcratch a Publick revenge out of me that hath put him on to play ſuch poore game as this, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then to ſit out, namely that he will diſh up other mens arguments ſippeted with his own boaſting and railing, rather then not to be ſeen a man in Print [and ſo he muſt needs Print; and he muſt needs print <hi>Queries</hi> about <hi>Chriſtmas</hi> day that he might be ſome body, though the moſt part of them were fiilched out of Mr. <hi>Prynns Hiſtriomaſtix</hi> and the Scripture Almanack] but if there be ſuch an itch in him, I would he would claw himſelf, and not make other men ſmart for his ſcrubbing: It is not any ſmart in my reputation that troubles me though he thought to have laſhed that to the fleying and ſalting <hi>[I have innocency is vipers proof]</hi> but it is a ſmart to me that I muſt be troubled to ſpend time and labour in anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſtollen arguments, idle vapours, ſnarlings and barkings, and fond impertinencies of a man that cares not much what he ſayes, ſo it be in Print, that it may be talked of, and whoſe very element is mud and troubled waters. Were I ſuch an one for ſenſeleſneſſe and for impiety as he would make me, I I were fitter to live among brute beaſts then amongſt men, or rather I were not fit to live upon the earth at all. But my wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe is in heaven, and within me, what is my heart; and my teſtimony is in the Country where I have lived, where is and hath been my converſation; and let the few lines enſuing be the evidence whether I am mad and raging as he would repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent me. I ſee if Maſter <hi>Heming</hi> were the doomer of my finall eſtate that it would go but hardly with me, but I am to ſtand or fall to mine own maſter, into whoſe hands let me fall, for with him is mercy. However, I am traduced by the moſt uncharitable cenſure of this man, to have <hi>contra. conſcientiouſly upon a malignant deſigne and for the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement of my maſters kingdom</hi> [you can eaſily read what ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter his charity meaneth] taken up and maintained that opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb facs="tcp:150113:6"/>that I hold: yet the Lord God of Gods he knoweth and I deſire that Iſrael may know, that never any ſuch thing entred or got the leaſt footing in my thoughts: but what I hold and maintain, I do it according to the beſt light I can receive from Scripture, according to the beſt dictates of my conſcience up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that information, &amp; as in the ſight of God, &amp; as in dread and reverence of his divine word. Therfore it doth fret me as little as it doth pleaſe him much in all the reproaches he doth caſt upon me: and if he can count it the part of a Saint to uſe ſuch language, I can very well account it the part of a Chriſtian to undergo it. And I go not alone neither under that burden; for all that are not directly of his mind and practiſe, have ſhare in the ſame reviling and cenſure with me.</p>
            <p>I ſhall for all his ſcornes, calumnies, uncharitableneſſe, and virulency, leave him theſe places for an anſwer, <hi>Prov.</hi> 30.12.13.14. <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.22. and 7.1. <hi>Luk.</hi> 18.9. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4.31. &amp;c. And as for the cauſe that is between us, I ſhall moſt heartily lay the umpirage of it before any impartiall and indifferent rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, when they ſhall have had the patience to hear what I can ſay for the things I hold, as they have ſeen what he hath ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken for himſelf.</p>

               <hi>Anſwer.</hi> I would gladly know, what neceſſity hath engaged him in ſuch Controverſies: I am ſure it is as free and more ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary for him, to teach the ſound and ſaving doctrines of ſalvation (if he had a calling thereto and were able) and would be more acceptable and profitable to thoſe that heare them, then to trouble mens minds with empty and windy Controverſies, which only ſwell and puffe up, but edifie not. I am paſt doubting, and I dare ſay that all men that do ſeriouſly mind ſalvation will be of the ſame mind with me, that teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Doctrines of Faith, repentance, ſelf-deniall, charity, mortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and the like, is a thouſand t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

I dare ſay thoſe points never brought men to heaven. I queſtion whether ever they forwarded any men ſo much as one ſtep thitherward: Admit I were come up
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:150113:7" rendition="simple:additions"/>to Mr <hi>Hemings</hi> opinion in theſe points as far as he would have me, that I would ſpeak as bitterly againſt <hi>Iudas</hi> his receiving of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and mixt Communion as he doth, that I abhorred baptizing of Infants, that I would be re-baptized, that I would cry out againſt ſinging of Pſalms in the publick Congregation, that I would hold or practiſe in theſe or ſuch like things as theſe as punctually and completely a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> hee could deſire; I pray you what were I nearer heaven for all this? what one haires breath had this ſtept me forward towards God or towards ſalvation? Might not Publicans, Harlots, <hi>Ahabs, Cains,</hi> and incarnate Devils do as much as all this, and be Devils ſtill? Why ſhould Mr. <hi>Heming</hi> engage himſelf and inſiſt ſo much upon ſuch fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe things as theſe, as he hath done, when it is as free and as open before him to deal onely with ſound and ſaving doctrines? and it would be more comfortable for him ſo to do, upon his finall account, and it would be more gracefull to the hearers, in caſe Mr <hi>Heming</hi> were able or idoneous thereunto.</p>
            <p>I will appeal to all ſtanders by, of unbiaſſed and impartiall judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; yea, I durſt appeal to Mr <hi>Hemings</hi> own conſcience if unmuffled or not altogether ignorant, whether the inſiſting upon ſuch doctrines as theſe, upon which he ſpends the moſt of his publike diſcourſes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong us, tends not more to gaine a party, then to ſave a ſoul. I would ask of him, what comfortable account doth he think to give, when he comes to give up his reckoning betwixt God and himſelf? firſt, for taking upon him the profeſſion of a Miniſter, and then for neglecting to proſecute the wholſome doctrines that ſhould ſave ſoules ſo much as he doth, and declaming almoſt only upon ſuch windy and needleſſe points as theſe, which only breed ill humors, and diſturbance in the minds of men, and diviſions and heart-burnings in Congregations, and tend not one jot or tittle to edification: And I would deſire the Saints in and about <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ttoxater,</hi> that he meaneth, in the bowels of Chriſt and in the melting tendering of their own ſalvation, to think ſeriouſly with themſelves upon their reckoning with God, upon theſe points: whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they think the zeal againſt, Infants baptiſm, mixt Communion, and ſuch like punctilio's, the beſt upon which muſt needs coole zeal in better things, can redound to their comfort, in the day of their ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count? Let me by way of parable lay before them two men upon their death-beds, and reckoning with God upon their courſe and carriage in Religion: One of them of the old light as it is reputed, that is in the old and good way in Religion, in which all the holy men in <hi>England</hi> have walked ſince <hi>England</hi> knew the Goſpel: He hath this to ſay, from the
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:150113:7" rendition="simple:additions"/>bottom of his heart to God; Lord, then knoweſt, that I have ever deſired to lie low in mine own thoughts, and have reputed my ſelf the chiefeſt of ſinners, that I have loved and longed after the ſincere doctrines of ſalvation, that tended to the ſaving of my ſoule, and to the union in thy Church, that I have prayed, heard, ſung, received the Sacrament with the Congregation with a good heart: And that thy Word hath been moſt welcome to me, though it hath croſſed me in my deareſt humour and opinion. The other of them, of the New Light, and ſtrange doctrines that are now afoot, that were never heard of before, He hath this to ſay upon his reckoning for his comfort; Lord, thou knoweſt that I have accounted my ſelfe a Saint and deſpiſed others, that I have loved and been zealous for matters of queſtion and diſpute, that I have refrained the Sacrament, and ſinging of Pſalms with the Congregation, becauſe of the prophane in it; I have been an enemy to Infants baptiſm, and I have not cared for any Miniſter, that was not directly of mine opinion and judgement: let any one judge whether of theſe two is liker to come off with the greater comfort; and let any that know the way of Mr <hi>Hemings</hi> teaching, judge, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the greateſt bent of his endeavour in it, do tend to any higher comfort then the latter. Reader, however he talks of reluctancy in his ſpirit againſt ſuch low Controverſies, it is his own free choyce, and for ought we can ſee, his delight to be verſed and zealous in them, and there is no neceſſity or force upon him to urge him to it, that any of us can poſſibly conceive, unleſſe it be becauſe he is not skilled in more materiall points, or becauſe he would make and maintaine a party. And that he delights in theſe low Controverſies, for all his ſaying, it is enough to be collected out of his own words, who though he call them <hi>fruitleſſe,</hi> yet within five lines after, he profeſſeth that he <hi>findeth daily that low things are moſt beneficiall for believers of lowest attainments;</hi> God help thoſe Believers that find no greater benefit by any doctrine then by theſe low points. I can hardly beleeve that ſuch are Believers of S. <hi>Peters</hi> old edition, that deſire the ſincere milk of the Word and grow by it, but of the new edition under ſome New Light, that think to go to heaven ſomenew-found way. Then he proceedeth thus,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>What I have done in this is for their ſouls, who came out of Babylon, out of Aegypt the other day.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſwer.</hi> Let Mr <hi>Heming</hi> remember that paſſage, <hi>Wo unto him that calleth light darkneſſe;</hi> what he meaneth by <hi>Babylon</hi> and <hi>Egypt,</hi> is eaſie to pick out, namely, whoſoever is not of his opinion and practiſe:
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:150113:8" rendition="simple:additions"/>And hence come thoſe charitable and <hi>innocent expreſſions</hi> of his [as he cals them] Mr <hi>Lightfoot and his unholy Communicants,</hi> pag. 4. Mr <hi>Light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foot and his unholy crew,</hi> pag. 20. <hi>His prophane fellow-members.</hi> p. 5. &amp;c.</p>
            <p>The Reader, if he were of Mr <hi>Heming</hi>'s charity and no higher, might be induced to think that poor <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ttoxater</hi> is the verieſt <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Gomorrha</hi> upon the earth, and that till he came thither, it had bin led and lived in the deepeſt Superſtition and darkneſſe that ever <hi>Babylon</hi> and <hi>Egypt</hi> did: It is not for me to ſpeak, what a Miniſtery this Town hath had, ever ſince before Mr <hi>Heming</hi> was born [the relation I ſtand in to him that hath been their Miniſter ſo long, does ſtop my mouth:] But let all the Counteys hereabout, <hi>Cheſhire, Shropſhire, Staffordſhire, Darbiſhire</hi> &amp;c. let any in <hi>England</hi> that ever heard of old Mr <hi>Lightfoot Minister of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ttoxater,</hi> and what he hath been, and what his Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery and Converſation hath been, nay let Mr <hi>Hemings</hi> own Saints, be witneſſes what his pains, doctrine, life, and Miniſtery hath been among them for above this thirty years: If they have not diſſembled, the day hath been when ſome of them have acknowledged, and taken on them to think, that this Town in a happy Miniſtery hath gone in equall pace and degree with the moſt Townes of <hi>England.</hi> And now the caſe is ſo altered, that till Mr <hi>Heming</hi> came amongſt them, poor <hi>Vitoxa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> is ſaid to have been in darkneſſe, and in <hi>Babylon</hi> and <hi>Egypt;</hi> and he proved a <hi>Moſes</hi> and a <hi>Zorebabel</hi> to bring it out.</p>
            <p>I would argue with Mr <hi>Heming</hi> about theſe <hi>precious hearts that are come out of Babylon and Egypt but the other day:</hi> Some of them have pretented to holineſſe and preciſneſſe in Religion above other men, many years before Mr <hi>Heming</hi> ever came here, or his name was known; and it may be they were then more really taken for Saints then they are now: They were either Saints then, or they were not; If they were not, then they were hypocrites, for they took religiouſneſſe and ſanctity upon them: If they were Saints, then there may be Saints in <hi>Babylon and Egypt,</hi> and in my Communion: And I hope theſe ancient Profeſſors have not changed their charity though they have changed their light, ſo, but that they think there are ſome that communicate with me, that have alwayes demeaned themſelves in the evidence and demonſtration of holineſſe, zeal, piety, charity, and of all other Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian accompliſhments, in as full and conſtant a meaſure and courſe, as any of thoſe that Mr <hi>Heming</hi> hath brought out of <hi>Egypt and Babylon,</hi> and that have ever carryed as viſible works of Saints upon them, as any of theſe: But would you know what it is to come out of <hi>Babylon</hi> and <hi>Egypt</hi> in Mr <hi>Hemings</hi> ſence? It is indeed to come out of your wits and
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:150113:8"/>your Religion, it is to deny your Baptiſme, your mother Church of <hi>England,</hi> and the way of Religion in which all the holy men of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> have walked till now. It is to caſt off Parliament, Aſſembly, Directory, order and all Government in matters of Religion. It is to withdraw from the Communion, refrain from ſinging of Pſalmes, vilifie the Lords Prayer, and Infants Baptiſme. It is in a word, to walk by a new light, newly lighted, and newly come forth; to ſay and do as Mr <hi>Heming</hi> would have you, and he that doth theſe things, is as ſurely come out of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> as ever did Gypſies, and is as certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a Saint as it is certain the moon is made of green cheeſe.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Heming. I never intended this anſwer of mine ſhould have come to a publick cenſure, had not Mr</hi> Lightfoot <hi>and his unholy Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cants,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>dealt deceitfully.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſwer.</hi> The Frier deſired a Pigs heart, and a Capons liver, but good man he would have neither Pig nor Capon die for him. Mr <hi>Heming</hi> loves in his heart to be in Print, for that makes him ſeem ſome body, but he would not come to publick cenſure, for that may hap to ſpeak contrary to his ſelf-conceit and humour, and that is to him as the pangs of death. I will not queſtion whether he intended his anſwer for the Preſſe or no, it may be it had been as good for him to have let it alone; but let me thank him for publiſhing his good word, which I and my fellow Communicants have from him all along. Mr. <hi>Light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foot and his unholy Communicants dealt deceitfully:</hi> Nay, if I take you talking of dealing deceitfully, Ile talk with you, for I have my tale to tell to that purpoſe too. You may obſerve throughout his Pamphlet that ſtill he holds it out as if I pleaded for mixt Communion, which I medled not withall, but onely kept me to the queſtion, whether <hi>Judas</hi> received the Sacrament or no: but enter <hi>Matchiavell:</hi> His ſubtilty thought that he could not pick enough out of my aſſertion, <hi>That Iudas received the Sacrament,</hi> to make me ſo ſufficiently odious as he would have me: therefore he juggles this buſineſſe into the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute about mixt Communion, and there he thought he ſhould find railing ſtuffe enough againſt me, and how excellently he has husban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded it is abundantly viſible: To do him a courteſie, I will avouch for mixt Communion: and ſince he hath promiſed ſome elaborate piece in page 20, which will be about ſuch a ſubject, I ſuppoſe I ſhall leave him a few quaeries to find him work.</p>

            <p>This half dozen of points I would put out to Mr <hi>Heming</hi> to tagging; but let us have no boaſting nor railing in the bargain: I would have my points tagged without tufts: If he can from clear Scripture or reaſon contradict what I hold, he will diſcover more skill, then he hath ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed himſelf guilty of in all this diſpute: but if he cannot [but his Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gick can prove any thing] I could deduce ſuch concluſions from theſe premiſes that would make his opinion againſt mixt Communion run ſo on ſnickſnarles, that with fingers and teeth and all he would find e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to do to unknot it again, and make it run glib.</p>
            <p>The greateſt part of his Epiſtle he ſpends in railing and reviling me, in as taunting and bitter termes as he can invent upon this ſcore of mixt Communion, which though I medled not withall, yet he will needs perſwade you that I hold it, or elſe he were undone for railing matter. Will you hear ſome of his <hi>innocent expreſſions,</hi> as he calls them? <hi>I ſhould ſuperabundantly wrong him If</hi> I <hi>ſhould not rank him with the vileſt in the Kingdome, for with them he will have Communion as a mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the ſame externall viſible body, by vertue of which relation they are all his brethren and ſiſters; ſo that he hath his brother Drunkard, bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Thi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

It is well he lived not in the dayes of <hi>Samuell,</hi> or <hi>David</hi> or <hi>Eſay,</hi> or <hi>Jeremy,</hi> or any of the holy men upon record in Scripture: for it is ods they might have heard as much from him, as I do, ſeeing they were admitted by the ſame Circumciſion into the ſame Church, by which and into which every <hi>Iſraelite</hi> beſide was admitted, were he good or bad: if it were any diſgrace to them to have drunkards, murderers, liars, thieves, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> circumciſed as well as they, and of the ſame Church that they were of, I ſhall very willingly bear the ſame diſgrace with them. Take heed Mr. <hi>Heming,</hi> that by your ſelf united ſelect Communion that you talk of, you make not your ſelf holier then theſe holy men.</p>

My Communion is to this purpoſe:
<list>
                  <item>1. I deſire the purity and due adminiſtration, and receiving of the Sacrament, as well as Mr <hi>Heming</hi> or any of his Diſciples.</item>
                  <item>2. But I find no Text in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture that either warrants me to refrain the Sacrament, becauſe ſcanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous perſons do receive it, or that doth condemne me for receiving with ſuch, all the while <hi>I</hi> endeavour to fit and approve mine own heart as becometh that ordinance.</item>
                  <item>3. Nor do <hi>I</hi> uſe when <hi>I</hi> come about that work, to be ſo ſcrupulous in looking what others are, as <hi>I</hi> do
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:150113:10"/>deſire to examine my ſelfe, and ſo I take the Apoſtles meaning to be 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.29. Now how this Communion of mine ſhould be ſo op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite <hi>to all that is called good or holy,</hi> as he cenſures it, it is far ſooner ſaid then prooved; He ſaith <hi>it Diametrically oppoſeth.</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> The plain Letter in the former place is this: <hi>I wrote unto you in an Epiſtle not to company with fornicators: yet not altogether with the fornicators of this world, or with the Covetous, or Extortioners, or with Idolators; for then ye muſt needs go out of the world: But now I have written unto you, not to keep company if any man that is called a brother be a fornicator, or covetous, or an Idolator, or a railer, or a drunkard, or an extortioner, with ſuch a one, no not to eat.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now in this plain Letter, I would deſire Mr <hi>Heming</hi> to tell me whether the holieſt man in the Church of <hi>Corinth,</hi> migth not have his brother fornicator, his brother covetous, his brother Idolator &amp;c. Let him conſtrue me thoſe words, <hi>If any man that is called a brother be a fornicator</hi> &amp;c. 2 Let him ſhew me in all theſe words the leaſt ſyllable that ſpeaketh againſt my Communion: Yes, that he will do preſently with a wet finger, <hi>Not to company, not to eat with ſuch a one.</hi> But I will deny that <hi>not companying</hi> meaneth in that ſenſe, and that <hi>not cating with,</hi> meaneth in that ſence, but in a civill ſence, and I will give him till this day month to prove the contrary: So little is the Letter plain againſt me, unleſſe you will take his gloſſe with it.</p>
            <p>The plain Letter in the ſecond place is this, <hi>Be ye not unequally yoaked together with unbelievers; for what fellowſhip hath righteouſneſſe with un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteouſneſſe? and what Communion hath light with darkneſſe? or what concord hath Chriſt with Belial, or what part hath he that believeth with an Infidel? And what agreement hath the Temple of God with I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dols?</hi> &amp;c. <hi>wherefore come out from among them and be ye ſeparate,</hi> &amp;c. Now let me make his Argument for him out of theſe words.</p>
            <p>If you may not marry with Heathen Idolaters, you may not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the Sacrament with ſome Chriſtians. But &amp;c. <hi>Ergo.</hi> Never doubt the truth of this <hi>Syllogiſm;</hi> for it is in the Mood and Figure called <hi>A baculo ad Angulum:</hi> Who ſeeth not plainly that the Apoſtle ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth here of open and profeſſed Idolatrous Heathens? and from them to argue to Chriſtians that profeſſe the name of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> is ſuch a kind of Logick that when Mr <hi>Heming</hi> hath made it good, I will give him an Anſwer: So little plain is the Letter of either of theſe Texts againſt me, that if you plow not with his heifer, yea find not the riddle.</p>

If this were the queſtion before us, I could eaſily ſhew him how he ſtraitens the word <hi>Communion</hi> more, and applyes the word <hi>Saints</hi> otherwiſe then the Scripture doth, when it ſpeaketh to that point, of the Saints Communion. There may be <hi>Saints</hi> ſound in Scripture ſence, that are neither of Mr <hi>Hemings</hi> opinion, practice nor Canonizing, &amp; there may be found <hi>a Communion of Saints</hi> in other things beſides receiving of the Sacrament.

And therefore, never make ſuch a do as if I bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſphemed, or knew not what I ſaid, or it dropt from my pen before I was aware and I know not what; I am ready to ſay it again and again, that you fancy a Communion of Saints, you can never make good: And if this were the queſtion between us, I could ſhew you, that I rave not, but underſtand what I ſay, and that I am not utterly ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant what the Scripture and my Creed meaneth by <hi>the Communion of Saints.</hi> If you ſhould declaime, and raile, and rage as you do, ſeven years by <hi>Vtoxater</hi> clock I muſt yet ſtill hold, that there may be a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill in you Communion and a Saint in mine; and that all are not Saints and Devils that you hold ſo: and therefore you may ſave your labour, and ſpare your breath about this matter. I could tell you of ſome, that have carried as faire a ſhew as any Saint in your Kalender, and yet have been but painted ſepulchers, and I could name ſome that have been called as bad as you call me; [and that by thoſe that took on them as much Saintſhip as you do] which yet have been reall <hi>Iſraelites</hi> without guile.</p>

                  <hi>Conclamatum eſt,</hi> I have loſt the day already and never a ſtroke ſtruck, and Boyes and Girles muſt hoot mee out of the field. But harke ye, my honeſt Boyes and Girles of <hi>Vttoxater,</hi> before ye fall a ſhounting, let me tell you a ſtory: There was once a poor wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man foole [if my memory faile not, <hi>Seneca</hi>'s wife kept her for her paſtime at <hi>Rome</hi>] and ſhe was ſuddainly ſtruck blind and loſt her ſeeing: Now all the world could not perſwade her that ſhe was blind, but cryed out that the houſe was dark, and thought rather that the day and the Sunne had loſt their light, then ſhee her ſight. My lads, if you muſt ſhame any body for blind beetledneſſe, it muſt bee Mr <hi>Heming</hi> that calls you out, for hee ſees not what hee ſhould ſee in <hi>Ioh.</hi> 13. and yet he cryes out, the blindneſſe is mine at <hi>Ioh.</hi> 12. The fault is in his eyes, but you cannot perſwade him ſo, but that I have loſt my ſight.</p>
               <p>How miſerably low and loſt am I in his eſteeme? when for my Moralls he holds mee worſe then any man, and for mine in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellectualls leſſe then any reading boy. Though I know hee thinks of me as bad as bad can be, I thank him for it; yet truly, I did not think hee had reputed mee ſo very ſilly and ſenſeleſſe, as either not to ſee at all, that the Supper in <hi>Ioh.</hi> 12. was at <hi>Bethany,</hi> or ſo little to obſerve it as to commit ſo groſſe a miſtake as hee would put upon me. Sir, Certainly either you are mightily miſtaken in mee, or you would put a mighty fallacy upon the Reader: Aſſure your ſelfe I can ſpell and read the word <hi>Bethany</hi> in <hi>Ioh.</hi> 12.1. as well as any Boy or Girle in all <hi>Vtoxater</hi> Pariſh, and I ſaw it as plaine when I entred upon this Diſpute, as ever your eyes ſay it in all your life: But you did not ſee <hi>Bethany</hi> in <hi>Ioh.</hi> 13.1.2.3. which I did, and that is the reaſon of all this vapouring. And hereupon, you either ſillily or willingly, falſifie our Queſtion, and ſo the poor Boyes and Girles that are called out to ſhame me, will either ſhame themſelves for ſhouting at they know not what, or rather ſhame you for vapouring at you know not what. Our Queſtion is not whether the Supper in <hi>Ioh.</hi> 12. or the Supper in <hi>Ioh.</hi> 13. were the Supper at <hi>Bethany,</hi> but our Queſtion is <hi>Whether that Supper in Ioh.</hi> 13. <hi>were not at</hi> Bethany, <hi>as well as that Supper in Ioh.</hi> 12.

He ſaies that that Supper in <hi>Iohn</hi> 13. was at <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> and that it was on the Paſſeover night, and proves by that Chapter that <hi>Iudas</hi> went out before the Sacrament, and yet is there not the leaſt mention of <hi>Ieruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem</hi> or the Paſſeover night, nor of the Sacrament in all that Chapter. He alledgeth this Chapter of <hi>Iohn</hi> as his chief ground to prove that <hi>Iudas</hi> did not receive the Sacrament, when there is not one word of the Sacrament in all <hi>Iohns</hi> Goſpel. He produceth this Evangeliſt to judge of a matter [and that to gainſay the other three that averre it] who ſpeaks not one word fo the thing to be judged of. And yet when <hi>I</hi> ſay the Supper in <hi>Iohn</hi> 13. was at <hi>Bethany,</hi> he thinks this a good rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, to ſay no, becauſe <hi>Bethany</hi> is not there named.</p>
               <p>Before <hi>I</hi> come to ſhew that <hi>Bethany</hi> was the place of that Supper,</p>
               <p>

               <p>

               <p>The anſwer that Maſter <hi>Heming</hi> returns to this Argument is firſt thus, <hi>Perhaps Chriſt did not eat the Paſchall Lamb upon the ſame day the Jewes did,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>And then the feaſt the Diſciples dreamed of might very well be the Iewes Paſſeover, kept a day after: I could ſpeak more for proof of this from</hi> Iohn. 18.21. and 19.14. <hi>then ever Mr.</hi> Lightfoot <hi>will be able to anſwer.</hi>

Sure the man did not know that the Paſchall Lambes were ſlaine by the Prieſts at the Altar, and the blood ſprinkled there, and they ſlaine, and the blood ſprinkled in the name of a Paſchall: and ſure he did not know how high a tranſgreſſion it was reputed by the Iewes to eat the Paſſeover on a wrong day: had he known and weighed theſe things, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:150113:14" rendition="simple:additions"/>he would find it a harder buſineſſe for Chriſt to eat the Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeover a day before the Iewes, then he dreamed of. But why do I talk of ſuch things as theſe to him, when he puts a perhaps upon ſo plaine Texts of the Evangeliſts.</p>
               <p>As for that tiring work that he would ſet me upon out of <hi>John</hi> 18.28. and 19.14. I will tell him this before hand, that if I can make nothing of thoſe places, I will deny mine own skill, judgement, and opinion before I will deny the plaine text of the Evangeliſts as he doth: But I need not to eat mine aſſertion for any thing that thoſe places hold out againſt it.</p>
               <p>Hee is it but little acquainted with Scripture, or with the Iewes cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomes about the Paſſeover that knowes not that there were Paſſeover Bullocks and other Peace-offerings to be eaten in the week of the Feaſt, as well as the Lamb was upon its day. 2. <hi>Chron.</hi> 30.21.24. and 35 7, 8. And that theſe are called the Paſſeover as well as the Lambe. <hi>Deut.</hi> 16.2. compared with <hi>Exod.</hi> 12.5.</p>
               <p>And to take up theſe Texts, which in Maſter <hi>Hemings con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception</hi> will bee everlaſting tiring irons to me. in <hi>Iohn</hi> 18.28. <hi>The Iewes went not into</hi> Pilates <hi>judgement Hall, leſt they ſhould be defiled, but that they might eat the Paſſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="17" facs="tcp:150113:14"/>that he uſeth me no worſe then he doth. I muſt tell the Apoſtles and Evangeliſts, that let them take heed what they ſay, and how they place their words; for if they ſpeak but one ſyllable awry from Mr. <hi>Hemings</hi> humour, he will tell them what they are before all the Pariſh. And I pray you Sir what were the Apoſtles ignorant of, that one may dawbe walls with their ignorance? Could they not tell whether the feaſt were come or no? That's the queſtion that you and I are upon, out of the words in <hi>Iohn</hi> 13.28, 29. and if you ſay they were ignorant of that, you ſpeak like Mr. <hi>Heming</hi> in ſtate and majeſty: and if they were igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of that, they were ignorant to the purpoſe.

I warrant you Mr. <hi>Heming</hi> and his Diſciples have had many a pleaſant laughing, and triumphing fit over this poor ſentence of mine, and have hug'd one another in this advantage of nonſenſe, as he has ſet it out, no doubt moſt learnedly to them. Mee thinkes I ſee him ſcratch the elbow, and hear him laugh hither. But I muſt put him in mind of <hi>Seneca's</hi> wifes fool again; hee cries out I am blind, when the blindneſſe is his owne.</p>
               <p>This great Maſter of <hi>Iſrael</hi> never dreamed in all his life, of any Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath, but only the ordinary weekly Sabbath, and from this ignorance comes all this laughter; but it ſeems I muſt be his teacher now, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form him, that the firſt and laſt day in the Paſſeover week was a Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baticall day, or a Sabbath, and ſo was alſo the firſt and laſt day of the Feaſt of Tabernacles, &amp;c. Had he but well weighted <hi>Exod.</hi> 12.16. <hi>Levit.</hi> 23.7. and ſeriouſly conſulted how the word <hi>Sabbath</hi> is to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood in <hi>Levit.</hi> 23.15.

               <p>I ſay therefore again, that on the Paſſeover day at night the firſt Sabbath or firſt Sabbaticall day of the feaſt was entred: and hereupon I argue thus. The Diſciples when <hi>Iudas</hi> had received the ſop, and <hi>Jeſus</hi> bad him, <hi>Quod facis fac cito,</hi> thought that he bad him buy ſomething: But if that were the Paſſeover night, the Sabbath was now entred, and buying any thing was neither lawfull nor poſſible. Therefore that was not on the Paſſeover night, but ſome night before: For it is ſenſeleſſe and groundleſſe to think, that the Diſciples ſhould think of Chriſts bid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding him buy ſomething, when nothing was poſſibly to be bought.</p>
               <pb n="19" facs="tcp:150113:15"/>
               <p>Upon that text therefore, <hi>Iohn</hi> 13.29. <hi>Some thought that Ieſus had ſaid unto him, Buy thoſe things that we have need of againſt the feaſt.</hi> I conclude,</p>
               <p n="1">1. That that was not at the Paſſeover ſupper, becauſe then nothing could be bought, a Sabbaticall day being entred. And 2.

                  </label> A fourth Argument I uſe to prove that the Supper in <hi>Joh.</hi> 13. at which the ſop was given to <hi>Judas,</hi> was not on the Paſſeover day, but before, is this.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Devill entred into</hi> Judas <hi>before the feaſt of the Paſſeover came.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But the Devill entred into</hi> Judas <hi>at the Supper, in</hi> Joh. 13.</p>
               <p>Ergo, <hi>That Supper,</hi> Joh. 13. <hi>was before the feaſt of the Paſſeover came.</hi> The <hi>major</hi> is proved, <hi>Luk.</hi> 22.3. <hi>Satan entred into</hi> Judas, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ver. 7. <hi>Then came the day of unleavened bread,</hi> &amp;c. By which it is apparent, that <hi>Satan</hi> was entred into <hi>Judas</hi> before the day of unleavened bread, or the Paſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over day came: unleſſe Mr. <hi>Heming</hi> will except at the Evangeliſts Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, which if he doe, let him give a good reaſon why, leſt hee ſhew himſelf too bold with the text, for his own turn.</p>
               <p>To the force of this Argument he anſwers nothing, but only becauſe I ſaid, <hi>The Devill entred into</hi> Judas <hi>at</hi> Bethany, hee catches up the word <hi>Bethany,</hi> and keeps a coyle with that, but to the pith of the Argument he ſaith nothing. Only in what anſwer he giveth to this Argument, which indeed is to no purpoſe, let me challenge him upon one paſſage which is
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:150113:16"/>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> utterly ſhameleſſe, and that is, when he ſaith, <hi>The conſpiracy is as cleerly placed before the ſop, as before the Paſſeover;</hi> but, <hi>Dic quibus in terris, &amp; Phyllida ſolus habeto;</hi> Let him but ſhew me where, and then I'le ſay he ſpeaks like a Scripture man; but if he cannot, I muſt ſay it is extreame impudence and impiety to aſſert any ſuch thing; for he makes his fancy equall with the ſacred text. There is not one ſyllable, letter, or tittle in all the Goſpel, that <hi>Judas</hi> conſpiracy was before the ſop, but there is as plaine an evidence that his conſpiracy was before the Paſſeover, as there is of any thing in the Goſpel; and yet becauſe this Gentleman hath fancied that the ſop was given on the Paſſeover night, he dares to equall his fancy with the divine writ, and ſay; <hi>The conſpiracy is as cleerly placed before the ſop as before the Paſſeover:</hi> That is, in his brains, but no where elſe; well fare a bold face in time of need.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> Another Argument, and wherewith I will clench up all, to prove the ſupper, <hi>Joh.</hi> 13. at which <hi>Judas</hi> received the ſop, was before the Paſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over day, is this, <hi>That it is not probable, nor can be conceived, that</hi> Judas <hi>ſhould receive the ſop, and ſo the Devill with it, and go to the High Prieſts, and bargain with them, receive a Band of men,</hi> Joh. 18.3. <hi>and betray his Maſter and all upon one night: for beſides the unlikelineſſe of it, the text is plain, that from the time of the receiving of the ſop, he ſought opportunity to betray him,</hi> Mat. 26.16. <hi>or how he might conveniently, &amp;c.</hi> Mar. 14.11. Luk. 22.6. <hi>And how improper it is to ſay a man ſeeks conveniency or oportunity, when be runs upon a thing and doth it on a ſuddaine; I referre to any one of common capacity.</hi>

               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="12"/> Now Mr. <hi>Heming</hi> gives this argument a threefold anſwer.</p>
               <p>Firſt he ſaith, <hi>'Tis probable all this might be done in one night: for</hi> Judas <hi>was not ſo far from the High Prieſt: the band of men not ſo far to ſeeke: the Devill,</hi> Judas <hi>and the</hi> Jews <hi>not ſo backward in driving on this damnable de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigne, as hee would inſinuate.</hi> I <hi>my ſelfe have knowne in this betraying age, five times more then this amounts to, brought about in as ſhort a night.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reply.</hi> I cannot imagine with all the skill I have, what that ſhould be, that was five times more then the betraying of the Sonne of God: And I wonder how Mr. <hi>Heming</hi> came to know that <hi>Judas</hi> was ſo neer the High prieſt, and that the Band of men was ſo ready at hand. There was an old wandring <hi>Jew</hi> talkt and ballated of, twixt twenty and thirty years agoe, if one had had the luck to have met with him, he would have told the whole buſineſſe: It ſeems Mr. <hi>Heming</hi> hath had the hap to meet with ſome of his intelligence, and that makes him ſo exact in this relation: but poor we that goe by the old light of the foure <hi>Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geliſts</hi> can ſee no ſuch matter. Mr. <hi>Heming</hi> grants that <hi>Judas</hi> ſate down with Chriſt on the Paſſeover night, and ate the common ſupper with him, and he ſticks not much to grant that hee ate the Paſchall Lambe
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:150113:16" rendition="simple:additions"/>with him; well, <hi>Chriſt</hi> after that, did but deliver the Sacrament, ſing a hymne, ſpeak a few words to his Diſciples, goe into the mount of <hi>Olives,</hi> and there <hi>Judas</hi> was preſently at hand to apprehend him: Now how <hi>Judas</hi> in ſo ſhort a time as this ſhould do all his buſineſſe; get toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the chief Prieſts and Captains, <hi>Luk.</hi> 22.4. (it may be the wande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring Jew ſaid they ſupt all together this night) bargain with them, raiſe a band of men, get Lanthorns and Torches all ready, &amp;c. he muſt be of a quick beleefe, that beleves ſuch quickneſſe.</p>

It ſeemeth exceeding ſtrange to me, that this uſe ſhould be made of this Chapter of <hi>John</hi> 13. who ſpeaketh not one fillable of the Sacrament, and which telleth plainly that that ſupper at which the ſop was gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, was <hi>ante diem feſtum Paſchae,</hi> as the beſt tranſlaters have rendred it, and that moſt truly.</p>
               <p>It were enough therefore for the overthrowing of Mr. <hi>Hemings</hi> opinion, to prove only that that ſupper in <hi>John</hi> 13. was before the Paſſeover day, and we needed not looke any further how many daies or nights it was before, yet that I may do him juſtice and my ſelfe right in the maintaining of this my aſſertion, I yet goe further, and averre, that

               <p>The <hi>major</hi> propoſition, that <hi>Judas</hi> conſpiracy began from the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils entring into him is as cleare in <hi>Luke</hi> 22.3, 4. as the Sunne at noon, <hi>Then entered Satan into Judas Iſcariot being one of the number of the twelve: And he went his way and communed with the chiefe Prieſts and Captaines how he might betray him unto them and they were glad, &amp;c.</hi> and then in <hi>verſ:</hi> 7. <hi>Then came the day of unleavened bread, &amp;c.</hi> Now let all the world, nay his very boyes and girles judge upon this matter: Children, when did <hi>Judas</hi> begin his treaſon?

H.</hi> give a ſatisfactory and convincing rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon why they are not to be thus underſtood, and he may then crow and triumph, but if he cannot, then doth he wreſt the Scripture, and having ſet downe his owne opinion, he will bring the Scripture to it, to ſpeake for his purpoſe by hooke or by crooke: I urge the Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geliſts words againe, <hi>Then Satan entered into Judas, and he went his way and communed with the chiefe Prieſts &amp;c.</hi> and let Mr. <hi>Hemings</hi> owne Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciples be judges, whether this prove not, <hi>That Judas his conſpiracy began from the Devils entering into him:</hi> and that the Devill entered into him upon his receiving of the ſop at the Supper in <hi>John</hi> 13. they will not deny.</p>
               <p>Now I need not to prove the <hi>minor, That Judas his conſpiracy beganne from Bethany;</hi> for Mr. <hi>Heming</hi> doth grant it, when he ſaith, <hi>Is it not plaine from theſe places</hi> Mat: 26.16.

                  <hi>The following Scriptures,</hi> viz. <hi>Mat.</hi> 26.2. <hi>Mark.</hi> 14.1. <hi>do not at all prove the Supper at Bethany to have been juſt two dayes before the Paſſeover, but that two dayes before the Paſſeover, the chiefe Prieſts and Scribes ſought how they might take Chriſt by craft and ſubtilty &amp;c. and at laſt concluded it muſt bee on the feaſt day</hi> (viz. <hi>the feaſt of the Paſſeover</hi>) <hi>leſt there ſhould be an uprore, &amp;c. Math.</hi> 14.1, 2.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Supper at Bethany is as likely to have been ſix daies before the Paſſeover as two, Then Ieſus ſix dayes before the Paſſeover came to Bethany, &amp;c. There they made him a ſupper, Iohn</hi> 12.1, 2.</p>

Mr. <hi>Heming</hi> reads <hi>Marke</hi> 14.1, 2, 3. thus, <hi>Two dayes before the feaſt of the Paſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, the chiefe Prieſts ſought to take Chriſt by craft, but they ſaid not on the feaſt day leſt there be any uproare. And ſix dayes before the Paſſeover, Ieſus be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in Bethany as he ſate at meat, &amp;c.</hi> Now I pray you is this according to the Goſpell of <hi>Marke,</hi> or according to the Goſpel of Mr. <hi>Heming?</hi> If this bee not ſhameleſſe wreſting of Scripture, I know not what is.</p>
               <p>Here are two things that he would foiſt upon the Evangeliſts that I
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:150113:18"/>durſt ſweare were never in their meanings: The firſt is, that he would perſwade you that <hi>Matthew</hi> and <hi>Mark</hi> do change the proper order and time of their ſtory; telling a ſtory of <hi>two dayes before the Paſſeover</hi> firſt, and then telling a ſtory of <hi>ſixe dayes before the Paſſeover</hi> after it. And the ſecond is, that hee would perſwade you that the ſupper at <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thany</hi> in <hi>John</hi> 12.1. and the Supper at <hi>Bethany</hi> in <hi>Mat:</hi> 26.6. &amp; <hi>Marke</hi> 14.3. was one and the ſame; and for this purpoſe he hath linked <hi>Mat.</hi> 26. <hi>Marke</hi> 14. &amp; <hi>John</hi> 12. together four or five times in his diſcourſe, as if the matter were paſt all doubting.</p>
               <p>Let me talke with him a little about both theſe, particularly,</p>
               <p>And firſt, about his perſwading that <hi>Matthewes</hi> and <hi>Markes</hi> order is here inverted, and the ſtory of the ſupper at <hi>Bethany</hi> diſlocated in them, I ſhall propoſe two or three things to him, which if he had conſidered of, or knowne before, it may be he would have beene more cautelous for his credits ſake, then thus blinde Biard like to venture he knowes not, nor cares not on what.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Let him ſhew me but one diſlocation, I ſay but one from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of <hi>Markes</hi> Goſpell to this very place, and then I will grant that there might be ſome colour of diſlocation here. If this grandee had ſtudied the order of the Evangeliſts, as well and ſeriouſly as ſome others have done, he durſt not for ſhame have ſaid thus much, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally of <hi>Marke</hi> who is ſo exact and direct for his method, that I ſay it againe, from the beginning of his Goſpell to this very place, Mr. <hi>H.</hi> cannot ſhew, not one ſtory, I ſay not one, which he can prove by any ſound evidence, or reaſon to be diſlocated; no, nor from this place to the end of his Goſpel: It was luck in a bag then, that he that is ſo di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect in all his Goſpel from end to end as never to change one ſtory out of its proper time and place, ſhould do it here to ſerve Mr. <hi>Hemings</hi> turne ſo pat.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Mr. <hi>Heming</hi> makes no bones of making two Evangeliſts to change the order of one and the ſame ſtory; the like to which let him ſhew me againe through all the Goſpels, and I will lay downe the cudgels: I ſay it againe, let him ſhew through all the Goſpels ſuch another diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>location in two Evangeliſts of one and the ſame ſtory, as hee would make this to be in <hi>Matthew</hi> and <hi>Marke,</hi> and I will confeſſe mine owne ignorance, and applaud his skill. I beleeve there is but one example in all the Evangeliſts, that two or more of them do miſplace the ſame ſtory, and that is not ſuch a diſlocation as this neither, as I ſhall ſhew him the difference if he have ever the luck and skill to finde it out.</p>
               <pb n="26" facs="tcp:150113:19"/>
               <p n="3">3. Sure he never obſerved how direct <hi>Matthew</hi> and <hi>Marke</hi> are in reckoning the dayes of <hi>Chriſts</hi> laſt weeke before the Paſſeover, from his riding in triumph to <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> till the Paſſeover day came. As <hi>Iohn</hi> tells, that <hi>ſix dayes before</hi> the Paſſeover he ſupt at <hi>Bethany Iohn</hi> 12.1. So they goe on and tell that on the next day or <hi>five dayes before</hi> the Paſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over he rideth in Triumph into <hi>Ieruſalem, Mat.</hi> 21.1, 2, &amp;c. <hi>Marke</hi> 11.1, 2. and at Even goeth to <hi>Bethany, Matth.</hi> 21.17. <hi>Marke</hi> 11.11.</p>
               <p>On the morrow, which was <hi>four dayes before</hi> the Paſſeover hee goes againe from <hi>Bethany</hi> into <hi>Ieruſalem, Mar.</hi> 11.11, 15, &amp;c. and at night goeth the ſame way againe, <hi>Mar.</hi> 11.19.</p>
               <p>In the morning, which was <hi>three dayes before</hi> the Paſſeover, he goes againe into <hi>Ieruſalem, Marke</hi> 11.20, 27, &amp;c. and at Even departs into the Mount of <hi>Olives, Marke</hi> 24.1, 3. <hi>Marke</hi> 13.1, 3. <hi>Luke</hi> 21.37.</p>
               <p>And thus are we come to the night that we are upon, namely two nights before the Paſſeover, where did Chriſt lodge this night? why, the Evangeliſts tell you in the Mount of Olives: where, there? why, <hi>Matthew</hi> and <hi>Marke</hi> ſay, <hi>After two dayes was the Paſſeover, and the Scribes ſought to take him, &amp;c. And he being at Bethany at meat, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Why ſhould not any rationall man rather take the method of both the Evangeliſts here to be direct, ſince it is ſo direct all along hitherto, then to make a jumpe backe again, no man alive can imagine to what purpoſe but onely to ſerve Mr. <hi>Hemings</hi> turne? It is apparent that Chriſt lodged two nights before the Paſſeover in the Mount of Olives.</p>
               <p>I ſuppoſe Mr. <hi>H.</hi> will not ſay he lay all night in the open fields, and I preſume he cannot tell where elſe to lodge him in the Mount of <hi>Olives,</hi> but at <hi>Bethany;</hi> and the Evangeliſts ſay, <hi>after two dayes was the Paſſeover, &amp;c. And Ieſus being at meat in Bethany, &amp;c.</hi> And yet Mr. <hi>H.</hi> will not ſuffer you to think that Chriſt ſupped this night at <hi>Bethany,</hi> but that the two Evangeliſts ſpeake of ſix nights before the Paſſeover. How ſenſleſſe is it to thinke, that when they have told you directly what Chriſt did the fifth, fourth, third day before the Paſſeover, and when they ſay moreover it was <hi>two dayes before the Paſſeover,</hi> they then ſhould jump back againe to ſix dayes before, and no man can imagine for what?</p>
               <p n="4">4. It is preſumption to diſplace the Evangeliſts method without good and ſound reaſon given for it: Let Mr. <hi>H.</hi> give but ſuch a one and I ſhall be ſilent.</p>

               <p>As groſſe or more groſſe (put what ſubſtantive to it you thinke good) is his ſecond aſſeveration, if he could perſwade you to it, and that is, that that ſupper at <hi>Bethany Iohn</hi> 12, and that ſupper at <hi>Bethany Mat.</hi> 26. <hi>Mark.</hi> 14. were but one and the ſame, and at the ſame time: which you muſt beleeve upon the word of this great Oracle though there be theſe maine and viſible differences between them.</p>
               <p n="1">1 That Supper in <hi>Iohn</hi> 12. <hi>was ſixe dayes</hi> before the Paſſeover.</p>
               <p>That Supper in <hi>Mat.</hi> 26. <hi>Marke</hi> 14. was <hi>but two:</hi> if you will beleeve the Evangeliſts as they ſpeake, and not make them ſpeake as Mr. <hi>H.</hi> would have them.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Supper in <hi>Iohn</hi> 12. was in the houſe of <hi>Lazarus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Supper in <hi>Matth.</hi> 26. <hi>Marke</hi> 14. was in the houſe of <hi>Simon the Leper.</hi>

               <p>Let you and me alone with this buſineſſe like a couple of wiſe men as we are, I have no friends that have any minde to be miſcalled or to fight with ſhadowes.</p>

               <p>You derive your concluſion, from <hi>Mat.</hi> 26. <hi>Mar.</hi> 14. &amp; <hi>Ioh.</hi> 12. and your argument lieth thus, if I can ſee it.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>The time and place whence</hi> Iudas <hi>began his treaſon, was the time and place of Satans entring into him with the ſop;</hi> this is proved by the authority of <hi>Luk.</hi> 22.3, 4. <hi>Then entred Satan into</hi> Judas, <hi>and he went and communed with the chief Prieſts, &amp;c.</hi> And of <hi>Ioh.</hi> 13.27.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But the Supper at</hi> Bethany, <hi>Mat.</hi> 26. <hi>Mar.</hi> 14. <hi>was the time and place whence</hi> Iudas <hi>began his treaſon;</hi> This M. <hi>H.</hi> granteth. <hi>Therefore the ſupper at</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thany <hi>was the time and place where Satan entred into</hi> Judas <hi>with the ſop.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. You conclude, <hi>That the diſcourſe between Chriſt and his Diſcipels con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the traitor paſſed that very night that he ate the Paſſeover:</hi> that is moſt true; but whereas you conclude withall that the like diſcourſe paſſed not at <hi>Bethany</hi> two dayes before, that is moſt falſe. And as for your rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, <hi>had</hi> Judas <hi>been diſcovered at</hi> Bethany, <hi>how could the Diſciples,</hi> John <hi>as well as the reſt, begin to be ſorrowfull, &amp;c.</hi> I will tell you how.</p>
               <p n="1">Firſt, if the diſcovery of <hi>Iudas</hi> at <hi>Bethany</hi> was privately to <hi>Iohn</hi> only, then your queſtion or reaſon is anſwered, &amp; I muſt put you to prove the contrary.</p>
               <p n="2">Secondly, though <hi>John</hi> knew it before, yet he loved not his Maſter ſo little, but he would be ſorrowfull too to hear of his Maſters betraying again, as well as they.</p>
               <p n="3">Thirdly, though the diſcovery at <hi>Bethany</hi> were openly to all, yet
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:150113:21"/>might they two nights after <hi>begin</hi> to be ſorrowfull to hear of it again<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="2 letters">

                  <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> He hath written that word <hi>begin</hi> in a different letter, as if he would have you to obſerve the <hi>emphaſis</hi> of that word, as if they had never been ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowfull about that buſineſſe before. But though they had heard of it two dayes before, might they not begin to bee ſorrowfull about it againe, when the diſcourſe of it was renewed? The Paſſeover ſupper was a meal of rejoicing, and in the midſt of that meale for <hi>Chriſt</hi> to ſpeak of his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traying, might it not dampe their rejoicing and make them <hi>begin</hi> to bee ſorrowfull? And beſides, I could tell of a propriety that <hi>To begin</hi> hath in the Goſpel language, that if he had obſerved, it may be he would not have pointed out the word for ſo emphaticall. <hi>To begin to do a thing,</hi> in Goſpel language doth often mean no more but <hi>To do a thing. They began</hi> to be ſorrowfull in <hi>Mark.</hi> 14.19. is no more in <hi>Mat.</hi> 26.22. then <hi>They were</hi> ſorrowfull.</p>
               <p n="4">Fourthly, At the Paſſeover ſupper they aske not who is it? but they every one ſay, Is it I? the former queſtion had been of doubting, as <hi>Joh.</hi> 13.22. the latter of every one vindicating themſelves, and aſſerting their integrity by that queſtion.</p>
               <p n="5">Fiftly, Doth he make no difference between <hi>Johns</hi> asking <hi>Chriſt</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, and all the Diſciples ſpeaking to him? and no difference between <hi>Chriſts</hi> ſaying, <hi>He to whom I ſhall give a ſop when I have dipped it,</hi> and <hi>He that dippeth with me in the diſh?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If all the three Evangeliſts had ſpoken in <hi>Lukes</hi> language; <hi>The hand of him that betraies me is with me on the table,</hi> and not mentioned dipping in the diſh; I wonder where Mr. <hi>Hemings</hi> Paſſeover night ſop would have been found then? but when <hi>Matthew</hi> and <hi>Mark</hi> ſpeak of dipping in the diſh, here is enough for him to make <hi>quidlibet è quolibet,</hi> as he can doe it moſt excellently.</p>
               <p n="3">3. He concludes, that <hi>Chriſt waſhed not his Diſciples feet at Bethany, but at the ſupper at</hi> Jeruſalem <hi>the ſame night he was betrayed,</hi> Joh. 13.</p>
               <p>This is written in a Goſpel of his own making (for it is not written in <hi>Joh.</hi> 13) &amp; ſo is his next concluſion, <hi>That the ſop was given at an ordinary common Supper; which Chriſt had the ſame night before he ate the Paſſeover;</hi> Let him find fair evidence for either of theſe in any of the foure Evangeliſts that we read, and I will ſay I never read them. Sure this man would make an excellent new Goſpel.</p>
               <p>And now let me uſe his owne ſtyle, and conclude too.</p>
               <p>I conclude againſt all he hath ſaid, or can ſay (but beare witneſſe I challenge none of his friends.)</p>

                  <hi>Repl.</hi> I thank you that you wil once grant I ſpeak truth, but you think it is for your own turne: But I pray you, how doth that that I affirm wound my cauſe? I ſay <hi>Jeſus</hi> taxed <hi>Iudas</hi> of treaſon at the Paſſeover ſupper; and I ſay he taxed him of treaſon at the ſupper at <hi>Bethany,</hi> two nights before: what wound do I give to my cauſe by this? If you find any advantage by it, make uſe of it.</p>
               <p>Wel: He granteth <hi>Iudas</hi> was at the common ſupper; but how miſſed he of the Sacrament? why Mr. <hi>H.</hi> will tell you as directly as if he had been there, that he was taxed for treaſon, and the ſop given him &amp; ſo he diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered and packt away before the Sacrament was in hand. And thus he makes a ſtory of his own head of the ſop given at the Paſſeover ſupper, which he will never be able to prove, while his name is Mr. <hi>H.</hi> but the ſtory of the Evangeliſt that determines the caſe, he ſlippeth over and ſpeaks not one word to it. I cite <hi>Luke</hi> 22.21. to prove <hi>Iudas</hi> preſent at the Sacrament, and this M. <hi>H.</hi> ſaw was like enough to wound his cauſe,
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:150113:22"/>and therefore (I ſhall commend his wit another time) he anſwers it with grave ſilence, not ſpeaking one word to it.</p>
               <p>It is apparent by <hi>Luke</hi> that <hi>Iudas</hi> was at Table after the giving of the Sacrament. Conſider his words, <hi>Luk.</hi> 22. ver. 19. <hi>And he took bread and gave thanks, and brake it, and gave unto them, ſaying, This is my body, &amp;c.</hi> ver. 20. <hi>likewiſe the cup after ſupper, ſaying, This cup is the new Testament in my blood which is ſhed for you.</hi> ver. 21. <hi>But behold the hand of him that betrayeth me is with mee on the table.</hi> What ſay you to this Mr. <hi>Heming?</hi> where was <hi>Iudas</hi> now I pray you, when his hand was on the table? Give me a direct &amp; clear anſwer to evidence that he was not at table at the delivering of the Sacramentall cup, and I ſhall ſay you are an oracle indeed. But let me have your anſwer out of the Goſpel of <hi>Matthew, Mark Luk</hi> or <hi>Iohn,</hi> &amp; not out of a Goſpel of your own making: Can any thing be plainer for my aſſertion then this? <hi>But behold;</hi> ſpel me thoſe two words, &amp; let me ſee what you can make of them.

This was it that I ſuſpected, that he would make a Goſpel of his own head, for what doth he other that makes the Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geliſts ſpeak what, and as his own liſt?</p>
               <p>By taking this courſe to change the method and order of Scripture, when mine owne liſt, and when it wil ſerve my turn, I will prove to you any thing: That <hi>Cain</hi> killed <hi>Abel</hi> before <hi>Adam</hi> was created, that <hi>Chriſt</hi> was crucified after he roſe again from the dead, that hee was baptized before he was born, and any thing in the world whatſoever: I would eat my opinion, and bite my tongue, before I would make the Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geliſts my ſlaves to ſerve my opinion; Let all the world judge whether this is to be lead by the Scripture, or to lead the Scripture whither you pleaſe.</p>

                  <hi>The Text doth not ſay he delivered it to the twelve, but to all, namely to all preſent, for</hi> Judas <hi>had gotten the ſop and was gone forth.</hi>

                  <hi>Reply.</hi> Readers, The Evangeliſts alledged tell you, that <hi>Ieſus ſate down with the twelve,</hi> and they did eat, and as they were eating, he ordained the Sacrament; &amp; not a ſyllable of <hi>Judas</hi> his getting the ſop, or going forth, but M. <hi>H.</hi> tells you ſo, it's a ſtory of his putting in amongſt thoſe Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geliſts: now whether it be fitter to beleeve them or him, judge ye.</p>
               <p>I would aske Mr. <hi>Heming</hi> this queſtion: Before the Goſpell of <hi>Iohn</hi> was written (as he is held to have written the laſt) if Mr. <hi>Heming</hi> had read any of, or all the three other relating the ſtory of the Paſſeover, how would he have conſtrued them then? where would his ſop, and <hi>Iudas</hi> going forth have been found then? Does not he think that all that read them then, underſtood them as I doe, and never dreamed of <hi>Iudas</hi> recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the ſop and going out? and yet they thought that they had the full ſtory of the Paſſeover ſupper too. I dare allow Mr. <hi>Heming</hi> 7 yeares ſtudy to prove that <hi>Iohn</hi> ſpeaks one ſyllable, of ſtory of the Paſſoever ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per: But becauſe he hath ſpoken of a ſupper and a ſop, and <hi>Iudas</hi> go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing forth, &amp;c. therefore he will have that the Paſſeover ſupper, though the Evangeliſts do moſt plainly ſay it was <hi>before the Paſſeover-feaſt.</hi>

                  <hi>Reply. Readers,</hi> I muſt tell you again, That whatſoever the Evangeliſts ſay, Mr. <hi>Heming</hi> muſt ſet their ſenſe: though all the three had ſaid, He <hi>gave
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:150113:23"/>the Sacrament to the twelve,</hi> yet you muſt ſay it was <hi>but to eleven,</hi> and though they ſpeak not a word of <hi>Judas</hi> abſence, yet Mr. <hi>Heming</hi> has told you he was gone, and that's enough for you to beleeve againſt 3 Evangeliſts. The allegation out of 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.5. is profoundly applyed: <hi>Paul</hi> ſaies <hi>Chriſt was ſeen of the twelve,</hi> &amp; yet you are to underſtand it but of Eleven: true: for the ſtory had abundantly and abundantly again told before what was become of the twelfth; and how they were become but eleven, and the <hi>Corinthians</hi> knew the ſtory well enough: But here though the Evangeliſts had ſaid, <hi>He gave it to the twelve,</hi> Mr. <hi>Heming</hi> will have you to underſtand it only of eleven, though none of the three ſpeake a word before of the abating of the number, or what was become of the twelfth.</p>

               <p>It is apparent in <hi>Luk.</hi> 22 that <hi>Iudas</hi> was as Table after the delivering of the cup; let Mr. <hi>Heming</hi> cleare it that he did not receive the bread and the cup; and let him ſhew that <hi>Iudas</hi> did not ſtay the ſinging of the Pſalme, as nice as he and his <hi>precious hearts</hi> make it to ſing Pſalmes in the Congregation, becauſe they will not ſing with the prophane; with all the skill all of them have, they will not evade it, but that Chriſt and the Diſciples ſung the hymne while <hi>Iudas</hi> was with them.

You muſt needs thinke (if theſe blind you not) that others have ſtudied the Scriptures as well as your ſelfe, and underſtand reaſon, and know the concernment of their ſoules, and would gladly be ſaved as well as you: and that hold their Tenents in Religion from a good conſcience, and would be as loth to deceive themſelves in things of ſuch weight as well as your ſelfe: what reaſon or warrant have you to thinke that no man thinkes right but he that thinkes as you doe; and none practiſeth right but according as you practiſe? and that none can walke to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven but juſt in your ſteps? and when a man from the bottom of his ſoul thinks that <hi>Iudas</hi> received the Sacrament, and holds, that it is better to receive the Sacrament with the Congregation, though profane perſons be there, then either to refraine from the Sacrament, or ſeparate from the Congregation, what reaſon or warrant have you in the world thus to vilifie him, and to ranke him with ſo vile perſons? I cannot hold <hi>The communion of Saints</hi> to meane in your ſenſe, I cannot think the Sacrament was ordained onely for viſible and reall Saints, I cannot hold that it is to diſtinguiſh betwixt Chriſtian and Chriſtian, I cannot either relinquiſh the Sacrament or the Congregation, muſt I therefore be matcht with all the theeves, whores, witches, and villaines of the gallowes? If this be meekneſſe, charity, and chriſtianity, it is ſo by ſome new-found or new-made bible, for in that that I have alway ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>died, this is held to be pride, raſhneſſe, paſſion, and uncharitableneſſe.

                  </gap>e man hath fancied a communion of Saints, and a reſervedneſſe of the Sacrament, which he will never be able to prove, and becauſe I and others cannot be of the ſame groundleſſe judgment, this is the chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table mans doom upon me.</p>
               <p>Doubtleſſe he would make a brave Judge, but let not me nor any friend of mine come under his fingers: No more adoe with him but ſirrah, do you thinke <hi>Iudas</hi> received the Sacrament? and do you think mixt communion is lawfull? yes and't pleaſe you. Then take him Jailor, for this is a companion, nay a brother of all the rogues and theeves that ever were hanged at <hi>Tyburne</hi> &amp;c. A ſmart Judge I promiſe you; bleſſe you out of his clutches.</p>
               <p>I may not forget neither before we part to thanke him for his good word in <hi>pag.</hi> 11. where hee ſaith <hi>Mr.</hi> Lightfoot <hi>hath gone a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt manifeſt light of truth, the whole current or ſtreame of Orthodox, godly and learned Expoſitors, common ſenſe &amp;c.

                  <hi>Reply.</hi> Here is charity by lumps: I wonder in what ſchoole he lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned it.</p>
               <p n="1">1. I pray you what malignity is it to beleeve and to maintain that <hi>Judas</hi> received the Sacrament? Yes, there is this malignity in it, Yee croſſe the imperiall minde and opinion of Mr. <hi>Heming;</hi> for elſe there is nothing in it contrary either to Scripture, Piety, Charity, Peace, Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſty or good manners.</p>
               <p n="2">2 I would faine know how this opinion is contrary to common ſenſe: I would go a mile to heare him ſhew this: He ſaith in <hi>pag.</hi> 1. <hi>Many weake-ones have ſtumbled at what Mr.</hi> Lightfoot <hi>hath ſpoken and writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, though there be neither Divinity nor Reaſon in it.</hi> Excellent wel groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded Diſciples I aſſure you that ſtumble when there is neither ſtone nor ſtraw in the way: He doth them but little credit in telling they are ſo eaſily ſhaken by that is neither Divinity nor ſenſe: Hee ſhould ſhew how it wanteth or contrarieth common ſenſe. Come let's heare it.</p>
               <p n="3">3 It were worth hearing, whom he ownes for Orthodox Expoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors: <hi>Beza, Calvin, Pareuc, Fulke, &amp;c?</hi> why, theſe were of the old light, I hope you ſcorne to call theſe men Orthodox: No ſayes he but I do not, I will call any man Orthodox as far as I thinke they will ſerve my turne: but if I finde them different in the leaſt tittle from mine o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion, I ſhall tell them what they are.</p>

                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Orthodox, godly, and learned Expoſitors? <hi>Zanchy</hi> ſaith, <hi>Multi &amp; magni viri,</hi> have taught and written agreeable to mine opinion. And if Mr. <hi>Gilleſpy</hi> were alive (whom you have ſo unworthily uſed as to ſteale his arguments by whole-ſteale and never to owne him) he could name you a man of my opinion, whom he would confeſſe a man Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodox, godly, and learned, and even a walking Library of Ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dox, godly, and learned Expoſitors, and that is Mr. <hi>Prynne,</hi> A gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman of that learning that you would have but little pleaſure to combat with in this controverſie.

               <p n="5">5 Whether I have gone againſt the manifeſt light of truth, and whether I have wreſted the Scriptures, I appeale from your cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure (for I am ſure you will be partiall in your own caſe) to the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partiall Judge of your heart and mine; and to the impartiall Reader who hath ſeen what hath paſt between us.</p>

               <p>And now let us ſhake hands and part: I thanke you for your kindneſſe and good words, as much as it comes to. I wiſh you more charity, humility, wiſdome, and moderation: I would adviſe you to ſtudy more and Print leſſe; your ſtocke is not ſo great as to be truſting too much abroad: You ſee what paines I have been at with you, I hope I ſhall have thankes from you for it.</p>
               <p>A wiſpe or a Cuck-ſtoole the reward of Scolds had beene a fitter returne for your railing, then patience and reaſon, but you ſee how I have waited on you with Salt and Spoones: I hope you will excuſe mee, if I finde my ſelfe ſomething to doe ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther time: for this I will promiſe you and here is my hand on't; That raile, rage, rave, call, miſcall, print ſenſe or non-ſenſe, vent
